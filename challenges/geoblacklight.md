# Community GIS Data Catalog 

## Status
Pending

## Challenge Owners
Chattanooga GIS User Group

## Impact / Purpose
Make data easier to find

## Possible Data Sources
- https://utcgis-igtlab.hub.arcgis.com/
- chattadata.org 
- City’s GIS Server?
- County’s GIS Server?
- CARTA's upcoming data portal?

## Description
The challenge is to stand up an instance of https://geoblacklight.org that catalogs publicly available Chattanooga GIS data.

A component of that would be crawling public ArcGIS REST endpoints and turning those into Aardvark files for GeoBlacklight to ingest.
